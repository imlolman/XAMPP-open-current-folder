# XAMPP-open-current-folder

> As XAMPP Dosen't provide a comfortable way to open php in another folder, everytime you need to edit httpd.conf in order to do that. here is a convinient script for that.

Run this script once on the folder that needs to be localhost and you are done.

`powershell ./script.ps1`
